# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game implemented in Python. The project consists of two main files: `simple.py` and `main.py`.

## Files

### simple.py

This script runs a command-line version of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The player is asked to input the number of games they want to play, and then they play against the computer. The computer's choices are generated randomly. The scores are updated and displayed after each game, and the final score is displayed at the end.

### main.py

This script runs a graphical version of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game using the Tkinter library. The player can select their choice from a dropdown menu, and the computer's choice is displayed on the screen. The game logic is similar to the command-line version, but the interface is graphical.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python installations)
